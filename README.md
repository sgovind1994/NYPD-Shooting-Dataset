## General Information
-I decided I wanted to answer the following questions:
1) Which borough has highest # of shootings?
2) Which borough has highest # of shootings?
3) See how frequency of shootings has changed over time
## Technologies Used
- R Studio
## Project Status
Project is: _complete_
## Room for Improvement
-I wouldnt have let my personal bias about what I already knew about NY shootings affect the variables I chose to focus on- instead, I could have focused analyzing variables such as the age/sex of the perpetrators.
